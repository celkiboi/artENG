# artENG - a freelance platform for art and engineering students
artENG is a Django webapp made for art and engineering students. The goal is that both students can post and apply to jobs.
## art students
Art students can apply to job posted by engineering students as well as post jobs aimed at engineering students.
### Example:
Imagine an art student Ivona "yvonne" Ivić. She is quite talented at designing mobile apps, and really enjoys using creative software like figma to put her ideas into paper. Unfortunately, she can't code, so her designs never leave the design stage. Fortunately she can use artENG to post a job offer. If any engineering student can implement her idea, she will pay him 500€. She can also apply to any job posted by an engineer, that desperetly needs an art student for his project.
## engineering students
Like art students, engineering students can apply to jobs posted by art students and post jobs aimed at art students.
### Example:
Imagine an engineering student Petar "pero" Perić. He is talented at coding, but his websites keep being unused because he can't design a good interface. Fortunately, he can use artENG to post a job for art students. Once he finds a suitable art student, he can make his web apps look good. He can also apply to any jobs posted by art students.
